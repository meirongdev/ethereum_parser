# # Ethereum Blockchain Parser

## Goal
Implement Ethereum blockchain parser that will allow to query transactions for subscribed
addresses.

## Problem

Users not able to receive push notifications for incoming/outgoing transactions. By
Implementing Parser interface we would be able to hook this up to notifications service to
notify about any incoming/outgoing transactions.
